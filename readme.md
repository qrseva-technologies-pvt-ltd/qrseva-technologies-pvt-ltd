**QRSeva** is a modern SaaS platform that helps restaurants:

✔ Show menu with photos, pricing, veg/non-veg & spice indicators  
✔ Manage orders in real time (Kitchen Display System)  
✔ Track table occupancy & billing  
✔ Run operations with fewer staff, faster service

**Scan. Order. Serve. — All in the browser. No app installation required.**

## 🌱 Our Vision

To build a **simple, affordable, and powerful restaurant management platform** that replaces:
- Manual order-taking
- Phone calls in the dining area
- Clunky POS systems  
with
- A cloud-native, QR-first, self-serve SaaS product

We believe restaurants should own their data, not pay exorbitant commissions.
